A[SENSORS]
B[CMOS]
C[Cellular Phones\nHandheld Devices\nWebcams\nVideo-surveillance\nBarcode Scanners]
D[CCD]
E[Digital Photography\nTV Broadcasting\nHigh Performance Industrial Imaging\nScientific and Medical Imaging]

A --> B & D
B --> C
D --> E
```

In short **CMOS** is for low quality mass production and **CCD** is for high end quality image processing.
