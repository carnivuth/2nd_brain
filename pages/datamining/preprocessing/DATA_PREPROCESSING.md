# Data preprocessing

Operations done on the data to make them suitable for machine learning models

## Aggregation

the process of combining 2 ore more attributes into a single one, this can be done to obtain differet goals:

- data reduction
- change of scale
- more stable data

## [SCALING](datamining/SCALING.md)


## [SAMPLING](datamining/SAMPLING.md)

the process of reducing the dataset dimensions making samples
## [DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION](datamining/DIMENSIONALITY_REDUCTION.md)

the process of reducing the number of features

## [FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION](datamining/FEATURE_SUBSET_SELECTION.md)

the process of selecting a subset of feature\

## [FEATURE CREATION](datamining/FEATURE_CREATION.md)

the process of creating new features from existing data
