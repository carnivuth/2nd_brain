# Data preprocessing

Operations done on the data to make them suitable for machine learning models

## Aggregation

the process of combining 2 ore more attributes into a single one, this can be done to obtain differet goals:

- data reduction
- change of scale
- more stable data

## [SCALING](datamining/preprocessing/scaling.md)


## [SAMPLING](datamining/preprocessing/sampling.md)

the process of reducing the dataset dimensions making samples

## [DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION](datamining/preprocessing/dimensionality_reduction.md)

the process of reducing the number of features

## [FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION](datamining/preprocessing/feature_subset_selection.md)

the process of selecting a subset of feature\

## [FEATURE CREATION](datamining/preprocessing/feature_creation.md)

the process of creating new features from existing data
