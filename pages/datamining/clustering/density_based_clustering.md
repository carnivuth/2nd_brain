# Density based clustering

The concept is that cluster are high density regions separated by low density regions. There are 2 approaches

- ### GRID BASED

	based on splitting the dataset in regularly spaced grids and count the number of object inside each grid

- ### OBJECT BASED

	define a radius and attach the number of object inside that radius one example is [dbscan](datamining/dbscan.md)
